## Vulpy Results

**Example of CWE-400**
```
Issue: [B113:request_without_timeout] Requests call without timeout
Severity: Medium   Confidence: Low
CWE: CWE-400 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)
More Info: https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.5/plugins/b113_request_without_timeout.html
Location: ./good/httpbrute.py:22:15
21	for password in passwords:
22	response = requests.post(URL, data = {'username': username, 'password': password})
23	if 'HOME' in response.text:
```
**üì£ Explanation:** The result shows a warning about a possible security issue in some lines of the code where the requests library *requests.post* is used to make an HTTP POST request without a timeout parameter. This means that having no timeout will make the request wait indefinitely. It can cause the program to become unresponsive - to hang or have an unstable connection. Therefore, attackers can use this to launch a Denial of Service (DoS) attack to make it completely unresponsive and unusable.

**‚òëÔ∏è Possible Solution:** A reasonable timeout value in the request can be added. This allows the application to wait for a response for a certain amount of time before giving up. This ensures that the application remains responsive and prevents a DoS attack.

**Example of CWE-377**
```
Issue: [B108:hardcoded_tmp_directory] Probable insecure usage of temp file/directory.
Severity: Medium   Confidence: Medium
CWE: CWE-377 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/377.html)
More Info: https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.5/plugins/b108_hardcoded_tmp_directory.html
Location: ./bad/libapi.py:20:14
19
20	keyfile = '/tmp/vulpy.apikey.{}.{}'.format(username, key)
21
```
**üì£ Explanation:** The result is pointing out that an API key is hardcoded in a temporary *'/tmp/'* directory path. This means that the code is relying on the /tmp/ directory to store sensitive information (in this case, an API key) without considering the possible security implications. This is a public directory where any user can write or read files. It becomes possible for an attacker to guess the file name and access sensitive information stored in this directory. 

**‚òëÔ∏è Possible Solution:** The best practice is to use a secure and unique temporary directory and ensure that the file is only accessible by the owner of the file. Temporary files or directories are commonly used by applications to store intermediate or temporary data, such as session information or file uploads. However, it is generally considered bad practice to use hardcoded paths for temporary files or directories because it can lead to vulnerabilities. If hardcoded temporary directory is writable by anyone, it could be used by attackers to execute malicious code or to store malware. It is recommended to use a secure and unique temporary directory and set proper access permissions to prevent unauthorized access or modification.

**Example of CWE-259**
```
Issue: [B105:hardcoded_password_string] Possible hardcoded password: 'aaaaaaa'
Severity: Low   Confidence: Medium
CWE: CWE-259 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html)
More Info: https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.5/plugins/b105_hardcoded_password_string.html
Location: ./good/vulpy-ssl.py:13:11
12	app = Flask('vulpy')
13	app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'aaaaaaa'
14
```
**üì£ Explanation:** The result warns that there is a hardcoded password in the code. In this case it is 'aaaaaaa', which also shows poor security practices. Hardcoded passwords are risky, and passwords that don't have a uniqueness to it can be easily cracked. This can lead to unauthorized access where attackers can exploit their access to systems. Hardcoded passwords also involve modifying the source code and rebuilding the application every time it needs to be changed. It is inefficient and can cause more accidentally modifications.

**‚òëÔ∏è Possible Solution:** It is recommended to use a secure password storage mechanism, such as a password manager or configuration files, instead of hardcoding passwords directly into the source code. This makes it easier to manage and update passwords as needed, without exposing them to potential attackers.

**Example of CWE-94**
```
Issue: [B201:flask_debug_true] A Flask app appears to be run with debug=True, which exposes the Werkzeug debugger and allows the execution of arbitrary code.
Severity: High   Confidence: Medium
CWE: CWE-94 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html)
More Info: https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.5/plugins/b201_flask_debug_true.html
Location: ./bad/vulpy-ssl.py:29:0
28
29	app.run(debug=True, host='127.0.1.1', ssl_context=('/tmp/acme.cert', '/tmp/acme.key'))
```
**üì£ Explanation:** The result here indicates that a Flask application is being run with the debug mode set to True. When debug mode is enabled, it allows the Werkzeug debugger to be accessed and it also allows the execution of arbitrary code. Debug mode is used for development and testing, and not for production purposes. Werkzeug can expose sensitive information, such as server configuration, environment variables, and stack traces. This poses a security risk because attackers can use the debugger to inspect the application's code and potentially exploit vulnerabilities. It is recommended to disable debug mode when deploying Flask applications to production environments. Flask is a flexible web framework for Python used to build web applications. 

**‚òëÔ∏è Possible Solution:** Therefore, it is important to ensure that debug mode is disabled when deploying Flask applications in production environments.

**Example of CWE-89**
```
Issue: [B608:hardcoded_sql_expressions] Possible SQL injection vector through string-based query construction.
Severity: Medium   Confidence: Medium
CWE: CWE-89 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
More Info: https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.5/plugins/b608_hardcoded_sql_expressions.html
Location: ./bad/db_init.py:20:18
19	for u,p in users:
20 	c.execute("INSERT INTO users (username, password, failures, mfa_enabled, mfa_secret) VALUES ('%s', '%s', '%d', '%d', '%s')" %(u, p, 0, 0, ''))
21
```
- This result is produced by a static code analyzer called "bandit" and it identifies a security issue in the code related to possible SQL injection vulnerability. Specifically, the result "B608: hardcoded_sql_expressions" suggests that the code is constructing a SQL query by concatenating string literals and input values without using parameterized queries or proper escaping of the input values. This makes it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, where an attacker can insert malicious input that alters the intended behavior of the query and gain unauthorized access to the database. To fix this issue, the code should use parameterized queries, which separate the query logic from the input values, and ensure that input values are properly escaped.
- This result means that the code constructs SQL queries using string formatting, which can potentially lead to SQL injection attacks. The code may allow user-controlled data to be concatenated into a SQL query without proper input validation, escaping or parameterization. This can enable an attacker to inject SQL code that gets executed by the database server, possibly leading to unauthorized access, data leaks, or data modification.
- In the specific example shown, the values for the SQL query are directly inserted using string formatting, which is susceptible to SQL injection attacks if the input data is not properly sanitized.

## Lets-Be-Bad-Guys Results

**Example of CWE-703**
```
Issue: [B110:try_except_pass] Try, Except, Pass detected.
Severity: Low   Confidence: High
CWE: CWE-703 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/703.html)
Location: ./badguys/vulnerable/views.py:65:8
More Info: https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.4/plugins/b110_try_except_pass.html
64	os.unlink('p0wned.txt')
65	except:
66	pass
```
- This result is from a security tool called "Bandit" and it is warning that the code contains a try/except block where the exception is caught but nothing is done with it. This is considered bad practice because it can hide errors and make debugging difficult. In particular, the except block has only a pass statement, which means that if an error occurs, it will be silently ignored and the program will continue to execute as if nothing happened. In this case, the code is attempting to delete a file p0wned.txt, and if an error occurs during the deletion, it will be suppressed by the except block. If there is a problem deleting the file, the program should handle the error in a way that provides feedback to the user and does not continue execution as if everything is okay.
- The issue with using a try-except block with a pass statement in this context is that it silently ignores any errors that may occur. This can lead to unexpected or undefined behavior, as the error is not being properly handled or reported to the user.
- In the specific case of the result you provided, the code attempts to delete a file using os.unlink, which may raise an exception if the file does not exist or if there is a permission error. However, the try-except block with a pass statement causes the exception to be ignored, meaning that if an error occurs, the program will not raise an error or otherwise inform the user that the file could not be deleted.
- This could be potentially problematic if the program relies on the file being deleted, as it may continue to run with incorrect assumptions about the file system. In addition, it could be a security issue if the file being deleted contains sensitive information and the failure to delete the file leaves that information exposed.

**Example of CWE-78**
```
Issue: [B102:exec_used] Use of exec detected.
Severity: Medium   Confidence: High
CWE: CWE-78 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html)
Location: ./badguys/vulnerable/views.py:72:12
More Info: https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.4/plugins/b102_exec_used.html
71	# Try it the Python 3 way...
72	exec(base64.decodestring(bytes(first_name, 'ascii')))
73	except TypeError:
```
- This Bandit result is indicating that the code contains the use of the exec() function, which can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. This can be a potential security vulnerability, as it allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system. The severity of this issue is considered medium and the confidence of the detection is high. The specific location of this issue is in the file ./badguys/vulnerable/views.py, line 72, where the exec() function is being used to decode a base64 string.
- The use of exec() in a program is generally considered a security vulnerability because it allows arbitrary code execution.
- In Python, exec() allows you to execute a string as if it were a Python expression or a statement, which can be dangerous if the string is not properly sanitized or validated before being executed. An attacker can potentially use this to execute arbitrary code and gain control of the system, as they can supply a string that could execute any command on the system.
- Using exec() is also often an indication of poor design, as it can be a sign that a more secure and maintainable design approach is needed. Therefore, it is important to avoid using exec() and instead find safer alternatives to achieve the same functionality.
