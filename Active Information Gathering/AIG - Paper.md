### NMAP
To find which ports are active:
**nmap 192.168.56.0/24**
```
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-02-28 12:45 EST
Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.1
Host is up (0.00012s latency).

Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.101
Host is up (0.00017s latency).

Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.102

Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (5 hosts up) scanned in 1.26 seconds
```

To find which ports from 1-1000 are open:
**nmap -p 1-1000 192.168.56.101**

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.10 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| vuln: 
|   cve_2016_8858: 
|_    A remote code execution vulnerability exists in OpenSSH
111/tcp  open  rpcbind 2-4 (RPC #100000)
|_ vuln: 
|   CVE-2017-16995: 
|   | The NFSv2/NFSv3 server in the nfsd subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.15. 
|   | allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) 
|   | because a length field is not validated in XDR requests to 
|   | NFSv2/v3 write arguments, related to fs/nfsd/nfs3xdr.c and fs/nfsd/nfsxdr.c.
|   CVE-2018-16884: 
|   | In the Linux kernel 4.15.x through 4.19.x before 4.19.2, map_write() 
|   | in kernel/user_namespace.c allows privilege escalation 
|   | because it mishandles nested user namespaces with more than 5 UID or GID ranges.
|_  CVE-2018-16885: 
|   | The do_xfs_setattr function in fs/xfs/xfs_ioctl.c in the Linux kernel 
|   | through 4.19.6 allows local users to cause a denial of service 
|   | (memory corruption and system crash) or possibly have unspecified 
|   | other impact by changing a certain XFS disk layout. 
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
| vuln: 
|   CVE-2007-2446: 
|   | The SMB server in Samba 3.0.0 through 3.0.25rc3 allows remote attackers 
|   | to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted packet that triggers 
|   | a heap-based buffer overflow in the (1) Samba daemon 
|   | process or (2) nmbd process.
|_  CVE-2017-7494: 
|   | Samba before 4.4.14, 4.5.x before 4.5.10, and 4.6.x before 4.6.4 
|   | allows remote authenticated users to leverage access to an 
|   | SMB1 share to create a symlink file to any location on the 
|   | filesystem when the underlying filesystem does not support symlink creation, 
|   | and then manipulate the contents of a non-symlink file to create a 
|   | setuid binary file that results in elevated privileges for 
|   | a non-root user.
445/tcp  open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 4.3
```
